Assignment 2 - CPS222 by Helia Dinh.

1) product-digit-sum.cpp:
  - The program computes ab = n and then the sum of the digits in n. 

2) split-list-balance.cpp:
  - The program breaks a list into M continuous, non-empty sub-lists such that the largest 
sum_vector(sub-list) for all the sub-lists is minimal.  
  - For example, the solution for a list {2, 3, 4, 5, 6} with M = 2 is 11,
wherein list is split into {2, 3, 4} and {5, 6}.  sum_vector({5, 6}) = 11.
